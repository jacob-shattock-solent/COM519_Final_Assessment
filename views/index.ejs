          <h1></h1>
          </h2>The Ukraine-Russia conflict is a ongoing political and military conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The conflict began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, a region of Ukraine, and has since escalated with fighting in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian military forces and Russian-backed separatists. The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of over a million people. The international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. The situation remains tense, with sporadic outbreaks of violence and ongoing diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.</h2>
